# incap

This is just a personal test project. Anyway, if you want to fork it, feel free to do it (just let me know your goal)

## Purpose
This is a test project for me to be able to test a few technologies I want to get skilled on:
* MEAN stack (with Typescript) 
* Bootstrap 5
* Micro-services
* Docker/Kubernetes

## Presentation of the application
This application is based on a old website we wrote in PHP long time ago with a friend. 
This site was a kind of collaborative blog where community people (our friends) wrote some articles on various topics, sorted into categories, on which we could add comments. 
It has been killed by the arrival of Facebook (sad, right?)
